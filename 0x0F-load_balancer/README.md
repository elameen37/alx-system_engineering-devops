# 0x0F Load balancer :wrench:

> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers the load balancer configuration for DevOps development

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* Improve a web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers. 
* Accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers.
* Make a infrastructure more reliable. 


## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Double the number of webservers (on web-01 and web-02)
1. Install your load balancer.
2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet
